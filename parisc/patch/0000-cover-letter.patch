Subject: [PATCH v6 0/5] parisc: system call table generation support

The purpose of this patch series is, we can easily add/modify/delete
system call table support by changing entry in syscall.tbl file 
instead of manually changing many files. The other goal is to unify 
the system call table generation support implementation across all 
the architectures. 

The system call tables are in different format in all architecture. 
It will be difficult to manually add, modify or delete the system 
calls in the respective files manually. To make it easy by keeping
a script and which'll generate uapi header file and syscall table 
file.

syscall.tbl contains the list of available system calls along with 
system call number and corresponding entry point. Add a new system 
call in this architecture will be possible by adding new entry in 
the syscall.tbl file.

Adding a new table entry consisting of:
        - System call number.
        - ABI.
        - System call name.
        - Entry point name.
	- Compat entry name, if required.

ARM, s390 and x86 architecuture does exist the similar support. I 
leverage their implementation to come up with a generic solution.

I have done the same support for work for alpha, ia64, m68k, micro-
blaze, mips, powerpc, sh, sparc, and xtensa. Below mentioned git
repository contains more details.

Finally, this is the ground work to solve the Y2038 issue. We need 
to add two dozen of system calls to solve Y2038 issue. So this patch
series will help to add new system calls easily by adding new entry 
in the syscall.tbl.
