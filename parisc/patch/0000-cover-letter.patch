Subject: [PATCH v7 0/5] parisc: system call table generation support

The purpose of this patch series is, we can easily
add/modify/delete system call table support by cha-
nging entry in syscall.tbl file instead of manually
changing many files. The other goal is to unify the
system call table generation support implementation
across all the architectures.

The system call tables are in different format in
all architecture. It will be difficult to manually
add, modify or delete the system calls in the resp-
ective files manually. To make it easy by keeping a
script and which'll generate uapi header file and
syscall table file.

syscall.tbl contains the list of available system
calls along with system call number and correspond-
ing entry point. Add a new system call in this arch-
itecture will be possible by adding new entry in the
syscall.tbl file.

Adding a new table entry consisting of:
        - System call number.
        - ABI.
        - System call name.
        - Entry point name.

ARM, s390 and x86 architecuture does exist the sim-
ilar support. I leverage their implementation to
come up with a generic solution.

I have done the same support for work for alpha, ia64,
m68k, microblaze, mips, powerpc, sh, sparc and xtensa.
Below mentioned git repository contains more details
about the workflow.

Finally, this is the ground work to solve the Y2038
issue. We need to add two dozen of system calls to
solve Y2038 issue. So this patch series will help to
add new system calls easily by adding new entry in
the syscall.tbl.

changes since v6:
 - changed from generic-y to generated-y in Kbuild.

changes since v5:
 - optimized/updated the syscall table generation
   scripts.
 - fixed all mixed indentation issues in syscall.tbl.
 - added "comments" in syscall_*.tbl.

changes since v4:
 - optimized/updated the syscall table generation
   scripts.
 - removed __IGNORE entries which was added in v2
   to suppress the warning.

changes since v3:
 - optimized/updated the syscall table generation
   scripts.
 - added missing new line.

changes since v2:
 - updated the syscall.tbl file by including missed
   entries.

changes since v1:
 - enclosed __NR_sycalls macro with __KERNEL__.

  parisc: move __IGNORE* entries to non uapi header
  parisc: add __NR_syscalls along with __NR_Linux_syscalls
  parisc: add system call table generation support
  parisc: generate uapi header and system call table files
  parisc: syscalls: ignore nfsservctl for other architectures
