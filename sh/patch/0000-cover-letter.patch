Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] sh: system call table generation support

The purpose of this patch series is, we can easily
add/modify/delete system call table support by cha-
nging entry in syscall.tbl file instead of manually
changing many files. The other goal is to unify the 
system call table generation support implementation 
across all the architectures. 

The system call tables are in different format in 
all architecture. It will be difficult to manually
add, modify or delete the system calls in the resp-
ective files manually. To make it easy by keeping a 
script and which'll generate uapi header file and 
syscall table file.

syscall.tbl contains the list of available system 
calls along with system call number and correspond-
ing entry point. Add a new system call in this arch-
itecture will be possible by adding new entry in the
syscall.tbl file.

Adding a new table entry consisting of:
        - System call number.
        - ABI.
        - System call name.
        - Entry point name.

ARM, s390 and x86 architecuture does exist the sim-
ilar support. I leverage their implementation to come
up with a generic solution.

I have done the same support for work for alpha, ia64,
m68k, microblaze, mips, parisc, powerpc, sparc, and 
xtensa. Below mentioned git repository contains more 
details about the workflow.

Finally, this is the ground work to solve the Y2038
issue. We need to add two dozen of system calls to solve
Y2038 issue. So this patch series will help to add new 
system calls easily by adding new entry in the syscall.tbl.

Changes since v1:
 - modified and optimized the syscall table generation 
   scripts.
 - fixed all mixed indentation issues in syscall.tbl.
 - added comments in syscall.tbl.
 - change log are updated.
