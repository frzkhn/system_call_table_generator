Subject: [PATCH v4 0/4] m68k: system call table generation support

The purpose of this patch series is, we can easily add/modify/delete
system call table support by changing entry in syscall.tbl file 
instead of manually changing many files. The other goal is to unify 
the system call table generation support implementation across all 
the architectures. 

The system call tables are in different format in all architecture. It
will be difficult to manually add, modify or delete the system calls
in the respective files manually. To make it easy by keeping a script 
and which'll generate uapi header file and syscall table file.

syscall.tbl contains the list of available system calls along with 
system call number and corresponding entry point. Add a new system 
call in this architecture will be possible by adding new entry in 
the syscall.tbl file.

Adding a new table entry consisting of:
        - System call number.
        - ABI.
        - System call name.
        - Entry point name.

ARM, s390 and x86 architecuture does exist the similar support. I 
leverage their implementation to come up with a generic solution.

I have done the same support for work for alpha, microblaze, sparc,
parisc, mips, powerpc, sh, sparc, and xtensa. But I started sending 
the patch for one architecuture for review. Below mentioned git
repository contains more details.

Finally, this is the ground work for solving the Y2038 issue. We 
need to add two dozen of system calls to solve Y2038 issue. So this
patch series will help to add new system calls easily by adding new
entry in the syscall.tbl.
