Subject: [PATCH 0/6] System call table generation support

The goal of this patch series is to easily add/modify/delete a
system call by changing entry in syscall.tbl file. No need
to manually edit many files.

The another goal of this patch series is to to unify the system
call implementation across all the architectures. ARM, s390 and 
x86 architecuture does have the similar support. I leverage their 
implementation to come up with a generic solution.

I have done the same support for work for ia64, m68k, microblaze, 
mips, parisc, powerpc, sh, sparc, and xtensa. But I started sending 
the patch for one architecuture for review. Below mentioned git
repository contains more details.
Git repo:- https://github.com/frzkhn/system_call_table_generator/

Finally, this is the ground work for solving the Y2038 issue. We 
need to change two dozen of system calls to solve Y2038 issue. So
this implementation will help to easily modify from existing system
call to Y2038 compatible system calls.

Questions:-
1. As we discussed prevously, we need to change mmap2 to mmap_pgoff.
   Shall I create a extra patch to do the same?

2. Patch 0006 is hack to compile the kernel. Could you have a look
   into this?

3. I need some *little* change in alpha patch. Do I need to to wait
   someone to respond and modify after that?

Firoz Khan (6):
  ia64: Replace NR_syscalls macro from asm/unistd.h
  ia64: Added an offset for system call number
  ia64: Replaced the system call table entry from entry.S
  ia64: Added system call table generation support
  ia64: uapi header and system call table file generation
  ia64: Temporary Hack
