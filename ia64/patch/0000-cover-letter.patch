Subject: [PATCH 0/5] System call table generation support

The purpose of this patch series is:
1. We can easily add/modify/delete system call by changing entry 
in syscall.tbl file. No need to manually edit many files.

2. It is easy to unify the system call implementation across all 
the architectures. 

The system call tables are in different format in all architecture 
and it will be difficult to manually add or modify the system calls
in the respective files. To make it easy by keeping a script and 
which'll generate the header file and syscall table file so this 
change will unify them across all architectures.

syscall.tbl contains the list of available system calls along with 
system call number and corresponding entry point. Add a new system 
call in this architecture will be possible by adding new entry in 
the syscall.tbl file.

Adding a new table entry consisting of:
        - System call number.
        - ABI.
        - System call name.
        - Entry point name.

ARM, s390 and x86 architecuture does have the similar support. I 
leverage their implementation to come up with a generic solution.

I have done the same support for work for alpha, m68k, microblaze, 
mips, parisc, powerpc, sh, sparc, and xtensa. But I started sending 
the patch for one architecuture for review. Below mentioned git
repository contains more details.

Finally, this is the ground work for solving the Y2038 issue. We 
need to change two dozen of system calls to solve Y2038 issue. So
this implementation will help to easily modify from existing system
call to Y2038 compatible system calls.
