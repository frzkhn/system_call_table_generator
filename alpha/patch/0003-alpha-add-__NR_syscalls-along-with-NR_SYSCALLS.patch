Subject: [PATCH v3 3/5] alpha: add __NR_syscalls along with NR_SYSCALLS

NR_SYSCALLS macro holds the number of system call exist
in alpha architecture. We have to change the value of NR-
_SYSCALLS, if we add or delete a system call.

One of the patch in this patch series has a script which
will generate a uapi header based on syscall.tbl file.
The syscall.tbl file contains the total number of system
calls information. So we have two option to update NR_SY-
CALLS value.

1. Update NR_SYSCALLS in asm/unistd.h manually by count-
   ing the no.of system calls. No need to update NR_SYS-
   CALLS until we either add a new system call or delete
   existing system call.

2. We can keep this feature it above mentioned script,
   that will count the number of syscalls and keep it in
   a generated file. In this case we don't need to expli-
   citly update NR_SYSCALLS in asm/unistd.h file.

The 2nd option will be the recommended one. For that, I
added the __NR_syscalls macro in uapi/asm/unistd.h along
with NR_SYSCALLS asm/unistd.h. The macro __NR_syscalls
also added for making the name convention same across all
architecture. While __NR_syscalls isn't strictly part of
the uapi, having it as part of the generated header to
simplifies the implementation. We also need to enclose
this macro with #ifdef __KERNEL__ to avoid side effects.
